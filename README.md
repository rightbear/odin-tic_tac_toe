Project: Tic Tac Toe

This is the ninth project to work in the "JavaScript Course"

(2025/05/01)  I complete this project with knowledges of JavaScript I learned in the previous course. I combine HTML elements like dialog and form to design the website. I decorate the page with CSS layouts such as grid and data attribute. Futhermore, I use Javascript concepts such as object, closure, factory function, IIFE and module pattern. With advices in Assignment of the project, I mainly use the concept of module pattern to wrap some functions with merely one instance. This activity strengths my skills in JavaScript.
